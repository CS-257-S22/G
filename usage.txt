Welcome to Coviz, a program that provides informtion and visualization for COVID-19 cases!

To try some of our functions, run: 

    python3 ProductionCode.py --help 

for instructions!

Examples of things you can do: 

    1. Get the latest number of COVID cases in a state (inaccurate number right now, due to the fact that we are using dummy data):

        Try:
            python3 ProductionCode.py -s Minnesota

    2. Get the graph of the COVID cases and deaths in a county within a date range:

        Try:
            python3 ProductionCode.py -s Alabama -c Autauga -d 2020-2-1 2020-12-1
